# MERN-Next-SEO-Blog-Frontend

An updated (2023) nextjs frontend for Ryan Dhungel's MERN-SEO-Blog:

Ryan's course is excellent. Ryan has really helped me to further develop my skills and broaden my Node, Express, and React skills to also include valuable Next.js skills.

I understand that it is very difficult for instructors to update their courses regularly. However, this is a challenge for students, as much code is deprecated over time and even superseded by newer code. This was definitely the case for this course. I had to revert back to earlier versions of node, react, mongodb/mongoose to ensure that the code could run without bugs. In addition, Google Login and Google Analytics did not work at all.

I then decided to update the entire application. Some npm-packages were a few years old, but still worked well, and were, therefore, still used, e.g. cors (4-years old), lodash (2-years old), morgan (3-years old), and shortid (2-years old). I did not use isomorphic-fetch (3-years old), as the the Fetch API that is part of the Web platform API (defined by the standards bodies WHATWG and W3C) is quite good enough.

In the end, this was a great experience for me, and I am happy to make it publicly available for anyone who is interested.
